- [ ] Complete documentation audit
- [ ] Ensure all current patterns are documented
- [ ] Check for conflicting guidelines
- [ ] Update tech stack if introducing new dependencies

- [ ] Create backup of current documentation state

## üìù Documentation Update Triggers

### Immediate Updates Required
These events should trigger immediate documentation updates:

| Event | Action | File to Update |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Bug discovered | Document issue and fix | TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| Feature completed | Update status | PROJECT_STATUS.md |
| New pattern discovered | Add learning | SESSION_LEARNINGS.md |
| Workflow change | Update process | DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md |
| Dependency added/updated | Update stack | TECH_STACK.md |
| Critical issue found | Add reminder | QUICK_REFERENCE.md |
| Architecture change | Update overview | TECH_STACK.md |

### Batch Updates Acceptable
These can be updated in batches at regular intervals:

- Minor typo fixes
- Formatting improvements
- Adding examples to existing patterns
- Expanding explanations
- Adding cross-references

## üéØ Quality Checklist

### Documentation Health Check
Run through this checklist weekly:

- [ ] **Accuracy**: Is all information still correct?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Are all features documented?
- [ ] **Clarity**: Can a new developer understand it?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Do all docs use same terminology?
- [ ] **Currency**: Are timestamps and versions updated?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Are links working and files findable?

### Signs Documentation Needs Update

‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Flags:**
- Repeated questions about the same topic
- Confusion about project setup
- Outdated command examples
- Missing information about new features
- Conflicting information between files
- Broken links or references

## üîÑ Documentation Lifecycle

### 1. Creation Phase
- Initial documentation when feature is planned
- Draft status in PROJECT_STATUS.md

### 2. Development Phase
- Active updates during implementation
- Regular commits with documentation changes
- Learning captured in SESSION_LEARNINGS.md

### 3. Stabilization Phase
- Comprehensive review after feature completion
- Move learnings to permanent guides
- Update troubleshooting with known issues

### 4. Maintenance Phase
- Regular reviews and updates
- Keep current with codebase changes
- Archive outdated information

### 5. Deprecation Phase
- Mark outdated sections clearly
- Provide migration guides
- Archive old documentation

## üìä Maintenance Metrics

Track these metrics monthly:

1. **Documentation Coverage**: % of features documented
2. **Update Frequency**: How often docs are updated
3. **Issue Resolution**: Time from issue to documentation
4. **Stale Content**: Age of last update per file
5. **Link Health**: % of working cross-references

## üö® Emergency Documentation Protocol

When critical issues arise:

1. **Immediate**: Add warning to QUICK_REFERENCE.md
2. **Within 1 hour**: Update TROUBLESHOOTING.md
3. **Same day**: Update affected guides
4. **Next day**: Review and consolidate updates
5. **Within week**: Full documentation review

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Commit docs with code**: Documentation changes should be in same commit as related code
2. **Use templates**: Consistent format for similar entries
3. **Date your updates**: Add timestamps to time-sensitive information
4. **Cross-reference**: Link between related documentation
5. **Version specifics**: Note version requirements when relevant
6. **Example-driven**: Include code examples where helpful
7. **Problem-solution format**: For troubleshooting entries
8. **Progressive disclosure**: Summary first, details later

**Remember**: Well-maintained documentation saves more time than it takes to write!
