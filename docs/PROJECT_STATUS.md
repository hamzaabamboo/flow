# PROJECT STATUS

> **IMPORTANT**: Update this file after every development session with completed tasks, new features, and progress updates.

## Current Phase: Phase 3 Complete ‚úÖ

Moving towards Phase 4 - Advanced Features & Integrations

## Latest Updates (2025-10-01)

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session

- **Type System Refactored** - All interfaces moved to centralized `src/shared/types/` directory
  - Modular type files: `board.ts`, `task.ts`, `user.ts`, `calendar.ts`, etc.
  - Props interfaces remain in components, data models in shared types
  - Fixed all TypeScript errors - build passes with zero errors

- **Structured Logging Added** - Integrated pino logger with colored output
  - Created `src/server/logger.ts` with pino configuration
  - Added `@bogeychan/elysia-logger` middleware
  - Replaced all console.log/error with proper logger calls

- **Fixed recurring task checkbox bug** - Proper instanceDate matching in agenda week view

- **Agenda Week View Redesigned** - Changed from table layout to CSS Grid
  - Full-width layout (removed Container, using Box w="full")
  - Grid layout with 7 equal columns: `gridTemplateColumns="repeat(7, 1fr)"`
  - Card-based design for each day with headers and scrollable content
  - Visual distinction for today (blue border/background) and past dates (opacity 0.7)

- **Build verified**: TypeScript compilation passes cleanly with `bunx tsc --noEmit`

### üöß In Progress

- Task size adjustments in agenda week view (user feedback: "tasks itself is still small")

- Task cards in agenda week view need size adjustment
- Some TypeScript warnings in test files
- Badge component size prop only accepts "sm"/"md"/"lg" (not "xs")

### üü¢ Minor
- Environment variables need production configuration
- Some ESLint warnings for dynamic styles
- EventItem component defined but unused

## Build & Test Status

```bash
‚úÖ bun run build       # Passes
‚úÖ bunx tsc --noEmit   # No errors
‚ö†Ô∏è  bun run lint       # Some warnings
‚úÖ Dev server          # Running stable
```
